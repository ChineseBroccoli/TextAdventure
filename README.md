Gerald's Foster Home!

Welcome to Gerald's Foster Home, where everyone is invited! 


One day whilst wandering the forests of Pakistan you run into an abandoned house. You decided to bite your balls and go inside. 
As soon as you walk in, that boring dingy house is transformed into a giantic, toy filled, wonderful emporium - the stuff of kids dreams. 
However, something doesn't seem right. Something seems off. Something seems too good to be true.
Can you solve the mystery before Gerald catches you?
